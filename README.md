News Article Summarizer
This project implements a News Article Summarizer using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to automatically generate concise summaries of news articles, making it easier for users to grasp the key points of lengthy content.

Features
Summarizes lengthy news articles into a short, concise format.
Utilizes machine learning models for text summarization.
Simple and user-friendly interface (Jupyter Notebook or Web Application).
Customizable parameters for summary length and article input.
